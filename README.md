# Wildfire Tracker

## Introduction

This project utilizes the Google Maps API and NASA's [EONET](https://eonet.gsfc.nasa.gov/api/v2.1/events) Events API to display active wildfires across the world. Basic information is given for each fire.

## Development

This project was generated using `create-react-app`. It is still under active development and is not deployed as of yet. In order view the current state of the site, you can serve locally using the following steps:

- Clone this repository locally: `git clone https://github.com/rossketron/wildfire-tracker.git`
- Run `yarn && yarn start` from the root project directory
  - this will start a local development server at http://localhost:3000

### Future Work

In the future, I hope to incorporate a news api and/or webscraping to include detailed article links and information for each fire. I also plan on incorporating the twitter api to show a live feed of tweets about the selected fire.

### Inspiration

As a former wildland firefighter, I know how difficult it can be for families and friends to find information on wildfires. My hope is that this site can serve as a way to alleviate some stress and worry for my fellow red card holders and their families.
